These are just a bunch of [Chrome User Scripts](http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/user-scripts) that I like to use.

To install one, open [chrome://chrome/extensions/](chrome://chrome/extensions/) and drag and drop the file from your Finder to the list of extensions in Chrome (opening the file directly doesn't prompt Chrome to install it like it used to, since Chrome [locked down installing extensions](http://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2664769).
